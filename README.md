# LIA: Dual-Channel Software Lock-in Amplifier with Digilent Analog Discovery
  ![Hard copy](./docs/images/HardCopy.png)
## Overview üîç
  - This software is a Windows-based software Lock-In Amplifier (LIA) designed for precision signal measurement and analysis. It interfaces seamlessly with Digilent Analog Discovery 2/3 devices, enabling real-time amplitude and phase detection up to 100‚ÄØkHz. Ideal for research, education, and experimental applications in measurement engineering.
  - The LIA, such as [NF LI5660](https://www.nfcorp.co.jp/english/pro/mi/loc/loc/index.html) or [Stanford Research Systems SR844](https://thinksrs.com/products/sr844.html), is an instrument that measures the amplitude $A$ and phase $\theta$ of sinusoidal signals using a technique known as Phase-Sensitive Detection (PSD) or synchronous detection.
  - This technique is shown in the following diagram and is also explained on [Youtube (in Japanese)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyuB1YW4qY).
  <img src="./docs/images/PSD.png" width="100%" alt="PSD">

  Amplitude: $A=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, Phase: $\theta=\arctan{\frac{y}{x}}$
  - The following code demonstrates the simplest implementation of a Core PSD calculation in C++.
    ```
    void psd::calc(double* pX, double* pY) {
        *pX = 0;
        *pY = 0;
        // Multiplier
        for (int i = 0; i < this->size; i++) {
            *pX += this->rawData[i] * this->sine[i];
            *pY += this->rawData[i] * this->cosine[i];
        }
        // Low pass filter
        *pX /= this->size;
        *pY /= this->size;
    }
    ```
    - However, after creating this software, the author discovered that a software, Digilent Waveforms, already includes lock-in functionality as a standard feature. For details, please refer to: [here](https://digilent.com/blog/how-to-separate-the-signal-from-the-noise/), [here](https://digilent.com/reference/test-and-measurement/guides/waveforms-oscilloscope?s[]=lockin#lock-in_amplifier), and [here](https://forum.digilent.com/topic/31231-lock-in-amplifier-phase-measurement-in-degrees-and-not-voltage/#comment-95389). How convenient!
    - The author recommends verifying the original functionality before using this software.

## Application Example üß™: Eddy Current Testing (ECT)
  - LIA is well-suited for non-destructive testing such as ECT. By combining AD620-based amplification circuits with sensor coils, users can identify material types and detect surface defects in conductive materials.
  - The following figure shows a circuit as a practical application of LIA for the ECT.

  - The AD620 and INA128/129 are known as effective instrument amplifiers.
  - The provision of power for the amplifier and sensors, such as coils, can be facilitated by the AD.
  - However, it is imperative to exercise caution with regard to the power supply limitations inherent to the AD. For instance, the maximum voltage from AD is ¬±5V, and the current is constrained by the capabilities of the USB connection or any additional AC adapters connected.
  - Due to maximum input voltage range of the AD is ¬±25V, the default voltage for this software is ¬±2.5V, which allows for the possibility of supplying higher voltages through external power sources. It is imperative to exercise caution and avoid the application of excessive voltage or current to the AD to avert potential damage.

  def makeChart(dat:np.array):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(3*2,3))
    ax[0].plot(dat[:,0], dat[:,1], label='$V_x$')
    ax[0].plot(dat[:,0], dat[:,2], label='$V_y$')
    ax[1].plot(dat[:,1], dat[:,2])
    ax[0].set_xlabel('Time (s)')
    ax[0].set_ylabel('$V$ (V)')
    ax[0].legend()
    ax[1].set_xlabel('$V_x$ (V)') 
    ax[1].set_ylabel('$V_y$ (V)')
    ax[1].set_aspect('equal', 'box')

    ax[1].grid()
    ax[1].set_xlim(-1.3, 1.3)
    ax[1].set_ylim(-1.3, 1.3)
    fig.tight_layout()
    fig.savefig('chart.svg')

  lia = Lia('./lia.exe')
  dat = getDat(lia)
  makeChart(dat) # Save time series and XY(Lissajous) plots of X/Y components
  ```
  - The following figures show X/Y components when the coil is in contact with different materials in the ECT.
