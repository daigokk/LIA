# Software Lock-in Amplifier using Digilent Analog Discovery
  ![Hard copy](./docs/images/HardCopy.png)
## What is this?
  - This software facilitates the construction of a software lock-in amplifier (LIA) within the Windows using the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 or 3.
  - The LIA is an instrument that has the capacity to measure the amplitude and phase of sine wave voltages.
  - It utilizes a technique known as phase-sensitive detection (PSD) or Synchronous Detection.
